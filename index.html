            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>“Passion” is a word so commonly used that the actual meaning gets distorted. It actually means “a strong and barely controllable emotion.” Passion is not passive: it’s a pursuit to act. Most people hate their 9–5 jobs, but few do jobs they love and are passionate about. </p>
